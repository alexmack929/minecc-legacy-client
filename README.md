MineCC Legacy Client Codebase
=====================

MineCC was a [Minecraft Mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_modding) which added a global instant messaging feature into the game.

It was the first mod of its kind and achieved a userbase in the thousands before I got too busy to maintain it.

This repository contains the client code for the mod, released to allow other modders to see how it all worked. Some of the conventions used are pretty bizzare (excessive use of `final` and an annoying aversion to any blank lines spring to mind...) and the code is all written for a much older version of Minecraft and Java, so take it all with not just a pinch but an entire tonne of salt!
