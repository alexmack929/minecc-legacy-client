MineCC Legacy: Client
=====================

Code for the MineCC Client, so that everybody can see how it worked and examine the code. Unfortunately the Server code was too fragmented, outdated and will likely never be seen again, much like MineCC itself. ;_;

If you, for some reason, want to document this code, go ahead - I'll review and probably accept pull requests.


¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That's about it folks.
